## Some of the things can we infer from it:
Our animated Race Bar Chart presents a compelling analysis of how the rating of a chocolate bar changes with its cocoa percentage.
- Majority of the Ratings are in the Mid Range: The majority of ratings for all cocoa percentages fall within the mid range (2.5-4), indicating that most chocolates are of moderate quality according to this dataset.

- Few High Ratings: There are no chocolate bars with a cocoa percentage between 60% and 100% that have a high rating (4-5). This might suggest that extremely high-quality chocolates are rare, or possibly, that the bar for a high rating is set very high.

- Variability in Rating Distribution: Different cocoa percentages have different distributions of ratings. For example, 70% cocoa bars are mostly rated in the mid range with a few low ratings, while 100% cocoa bars have more spread across the low and mid ratings.

- Popular Cocoa Percentages: The 70%, 72%, and 76% cocoa bars have a much higher count of chocolates, indicating these may be more popular or common cocoa percentages for chocolate bars.
