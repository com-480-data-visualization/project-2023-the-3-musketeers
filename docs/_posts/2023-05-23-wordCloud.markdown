## Some of the things can we infer from it: 
- Sugar is a must: The majority of chocolate bars, approximately 93%, contain sugar, although the quantity may differ. Chocolate that is free of sugar typically exhibits flavors such as bitterness and earthiness, which leads to an average rating approximately 0.3 points lower compared to those with sugar.
- Use more than one beans: Only 0.23% of chocolate bars use one kind of cocoa beans. Most manufacturers use two to four beans.
- Tricky vanilla:  While vanilla is used in only 13.41% of chocolate bars, the rating distribution becomes more varied when it is included. The interquartile range of ratings is noticeably larger for chocolate bars with vanilla compared to those without. This highlights the importance of considering the inclusion of vanilla in chocolate production.
